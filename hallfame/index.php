<P>The Hall of Fame process was originally the idea of Shirley Hoult of Scarborough.  In 1966, Shirley promoted the idea to Bert Garside, who was, at that time, Executive Director of the Ontario Bowlers&#146; Congress.  Based on Bert&#146;s recommendation, the Ontario Bowlers&#146; Congress Board of Directors gave Shirley their approval to gather the necessary materials, including the first submission forms.&#160; As a result of this initiative, it was only fitting that the first inductee was Tommy Ryan, the founder of our sport.&#160; While this induction took place in 1968, the Ontario Bowlers&#146; Congress subsequently formed a selection committee and nine more individuals were inducted in 1970.</p>

<p>Following that initial success, the process sat dormant until 1973 when Jack Fine and Bert Garside suggested to the Board of Directors of both the Bowling
Proprietors&#146; Association and the Ontario Bowlers&#146; Congress that a Builders of the Industry Dinner be initiated to honour individuals who had contributed to the growth of 5 pin bowling up to that time.&#160; This tradition continued for thirteen years and honoured forty recipients, builders, bowlers and suppliers.</p>

<p>In 1986, with the approval and cooperation of the Bowling Proprietors&#146; Association of Ontario, the Ontario 5 Pin Bowlers&#146; Association revived its Hall of Fame program and these induction ceremonies have become the new focus of the dinner.&#160; The fourteenth dinner in November 2002 raised the members of the Hall of Fame to one hundred and thirty-two worthy individuals.</p>

<p>Through the generosity of Hall of Famer, Flo Cutting, and, in memory of her husband, Percy, another Hall of Famer, each of the individuals inducted have their name inscribed on a plaque, which was significantly enlarged and is permanently displayed in the Ontario 5 Pin Bowlers' Association office.</p>

<p>While a permanent home for the Hall is still a dream, this dinner brings us one step closer to that reality and also illustrates the maturity our Association has reached as Ontario's premiere Sport Governing Body.</p>

<p>The dinner and induction ceremony are now an integral part of our organization, and we recognize the efforts of all the volunteers who have contributed to the success of this recognition program.</p>
